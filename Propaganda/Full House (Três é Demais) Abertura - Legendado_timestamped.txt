[00:02 - 00:14] Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Whatever happened to dictability?
[00:15 - 00:26] The milkman, the paperboy, even in TV? Did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me please. So what? Confusing me.
[00:28 - 00:40] Clouds as mean as you've ever seen And a bird who knows you're true And a little voice inside you whispers
[00:41 - 00:54] Don't sell your dreams so soon Everywhere you look There's a heart I'm here to hold on to
[00:54 - 01:04] Everywhere you look There's a face Of somebody who needs you Everywhere you look
[01:04 - 01:16] You're lost out there and you're all alone And I was waiting to carry you home Everywhere you look
[01:18 - 01:26] Everywhere you look You put your pride right on You put your pride right on You put your pride right on
